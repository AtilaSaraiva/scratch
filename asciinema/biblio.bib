	abstract = {The “Huber function” (or “Huber norm”) is one of several robust error measures which interpolates bel tween smooth ( 2) treatment of small residuals and rol bust ( 1) treatment of large residuals. Since the Huber function is differentiable, it may be minimized reliably with a standard gradient-based optimizer. We propose to minimize the Huber function with a quasi-Newton method that has the potential of being faster and more robust than conjugate-gradient methods when solving nonlinear problems. Tests with a linear inverse problem for velocity analysis with both synthetic and ﬁeld data suggest that the Huber function gives far more robust model estimates than does a least-squares ﬁt with or without damping.},
